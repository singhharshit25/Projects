# Tic-Tac-Toe (Project in Java)

## Description

This is an implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in **Java**. The game is designed for two players, where each player takes turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The game will detect the winner or announce a draw at the end of the game.

## Features

- **Two-player gameplay**: Players take turns to place X and O on the board.
- **Game loop**: A loop that alternates turns between players until the game ends.
- **Win condition**: The game checks for a winning condition after each move (row, column, or diagonal).
- **Draw condition**: If all spots are filled and no player has won, the game will declare a draw.
- **Console-based UI**: The game is played in the terminal/console.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Game Logic**: Methods and loops for alternating turns, checking win conditions, and managing the game state.

## How to Play

1. **Start the game**: Compile and run the `TicTacToe.java` file in your preferred IDE or terminal.
2. **Play the game**: The game prompts players to choose positions on the 3x3 grid (by inputting row and column numbers).
3. **Game rules**: Players alternate between placing X and O on the board until one wins or the game ends in a draw.
4. **Win condition**: The first player to align three of their marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
5. **Draw condition**: If the grid is filled and no player has won, a draw is declared.
6. **Restart**: After each game, you can restart by running the program again.
